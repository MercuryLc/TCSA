# How to use `detect_bw_sync.py`ï¼Ÿ

A new methodology for detecting busy-wait synchronization performance bugs through timing call stack.

# Usage
**`python detect_bw_sync.py <file_path> <output_path> [direction] [degrees_of_freedom] [threshold]`**

`file_path` : The path of the collected function call stack data, include the file name.

`output_path` : The path to store the output results.

` direction ` : The direction of identification of consecutive identical events(i.e., consecutive identical call stacks). 1 means top-down, 0 means bottom-up.

`degrees_of_freedom` : The depth when judging consecutive identical events for threads. 

` threshold ` : Set the threshold value for the number of durations. The default -1 means use the average value.
